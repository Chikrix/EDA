# EDA
My notes reading the book Exploratory Data Analysis with R by Roger Peng. 

My review of the book is, it doesn't have so much as I expected it'll have. Book is largely introductory. My notes doesn't cover chapters 1 - 3 as book mainly started from chapter 4. This is part of my project on resurrecting my R. 

This is part of my project on developing/resurrecting my R. Other reading projects includes;  

https://github.com/Chikrix/resurrectR - Reading R for data science using the curriculum by Hadley Wickham . 
https://github.com/Chikrix/rforLifeSciences - Notes and exercises following the R for Life Sciences Edx Series . 
https://github.com/Chikrix/learn-ggplot2 -  Notes and exercise solutions reading the book "ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis" by Hadley Wickham .   
https://github.com/Chikrix/exploratorium - My playground for practicing data science (acquiring, cleaning, EDA, visualisation, and some modeling). 

The above outlines my strategy for data science with R (excluding Machine Learning). Similar projects exists using Python and Kotin, and for machine learning . 

Learning path - 

Domain Knowledge + (statistics, data acquisition and cleaning/preparation, EDA, visualisation) > Machine learning (DL, RL) > Mathematics > Building Data products .
